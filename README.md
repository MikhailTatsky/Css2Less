================

** This project is a web-app which convert old CSS stylesheet into LESS dynamic stylesheet. **

## WTF ?

This tool has been thought for front-end developers who are tired of working with CSS. Here you can quickly convert your old CSS files to fresh new LESS files.    
As easy as copy/paste. You can also convert files locally by install the [css2less](http://rubygems.org/gems/css2less) RubyGems.

__Why .cc ?__
We finally decided that CC should mean Communist Compiler. Ya, we've a lot of imagination. If you know the real signification, please tell us. Anyway, it looks nice, doesn't it ?

__What about Internet Explorer ?__
Internet what ?? Ohâ€¦ Unfortunately, ACE Editor doesn't really support Internet Explorer. Not our fault ! But I'm sure you're not using it...
