    <h2>WTF ?</h2>
    <p>This tool has been thought for front-end developers who are tired of working with CSS. Here you can quickly convert your old CSS files to fresh new LESS files. As easy as copy/paste. You can also convert files locally by running the Ruby gem (see git repository above).</p>
    <h2>Credits</h2>
    <p>Css2Less is based on the work of Sickill (https://github.com/sickill/css2less). It's brought to you by Thomas Pierson (http://thomaspierson.fr/) & Nico Prat (https://twitter.com/#!/nicooprat). This service run on Sinatra and has been built with HAML & LESS (guess what) with the help of the excellent ACE Editor (http://ace.ajax.org/).</p>
    <h2>Questions ?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>LESS is cool. What about other awesomenesses ?</strong>
      You could also check out css2sass (http://css2sass.heroku.com/), js2coffee (http://js2coffee.org/) and html2haml (http://html2haml.heroku.com/). What a wonderful world.

      <strong>Why .cc ?</strong>
      We finally decided that CC should mean Communist Compiler. Ya, we've a lot of imagination. If you know the real signification, please tell us. Anyway, it looks nice, doesn't it ?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What about Internet Explorer ?</strong>
      Unfortunately, ACE Editor doesn't really support Internet Explorer. Not our fault ! But I'm sure you're not using it...
